# SkinCare-Recommendation-System
This project is a Skincare Recommendation System designed to suggest active ingredients based on users' specific skin concerns.
In addition to ingredient recommendations, the system also provides tips and suggestions to help improve overall skin health.

An AI agent has been developed using LangChain and Gemini 1.5 Pro to intelligently understand user prompts and generate relevant, insightful recommendations.
The Graphical User Interface (GUI) is built using Tkinter, Pythonâ€™s standard GUI library, to offer a simple and interactive user experience.
